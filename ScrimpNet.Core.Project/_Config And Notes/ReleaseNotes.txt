| Fix | CryptoUtils.HashCode | Would sometimes throw an error if plain text string was not correct length |
| Fix | CryptoUtils.Encrypt | Internal string conversion would convert to bytes incorrectly |
| Change | CryptoUtils | *Breaking!* Default (internal) keyfile has been updated.  Data encrypted with the old key will not be able to be decrypted |

!! ScrimpNet.Security.Core
| *NEW* | SecurityCore.GetSecurityQuestions | Returns a list of random questions you can use in your 'Forget Password' routines.

The library is embedded into the assembly so there's no need to fumble about with external files, and you can easily add your own questions. |
